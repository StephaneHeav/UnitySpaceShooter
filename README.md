# My Space Shooter

## Description :

It is my first project on Unity based on some tutorial from [Unity main website](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial).
I started this project to learn how to create a video game with Unity3D/C#. So if the game is not fun, not easy, not hard, not awesome, not cool or not enjoyable, it is normal because it is not the main goal.
I am aware of my poor knownledge but if you have some advice to give, i will be glad to take them.


## Sorry-list:

- My english skill.
- My C# code
	I started the language and Unity at the same time.
- Classes/Object/Code
	I started by myself, so i don't know any best pratice to each case.

Most assets comes from the tutorials.
Some others comes from the assets store.
And the colorful square comes from my poor Gimp skill (; _ ;).

	- My Pattern librairy is a version modified of [Bestiary management](https://theliquidfire.wordpress.com/2014/12/25/bestiary-management-and-scriptable-objects/)
