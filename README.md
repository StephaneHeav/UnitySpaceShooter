## Description :

It is my first project on Unity based on some tutorial from [Unity main website](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial). Be easy on me, i have no experience in Unity, Game Engine or C#.

I started this project to learn how to create a video game with Unity3D/C#.

So if the game is not fun, not easy, not hard, not awesome, not cool or not enjoyable, it is normal because it is not the main goal.

If you have any advice to give, i will be happy to hear them.

Unity3D website tutorials and assets store.
And the colorful square comes from my poor Gimp skill (; _ ;).

- Algorithme | Code :
	- My [Patterns library](https://github.com/StephaneHeav/UnitySpaceShooter/tree/master/Assets/Scripts/Lib/Patterns) is a modified version of [Bestiary management](https://theliquidfire.wordpress.com/2014/12/25/bestiary-management-and-scriptable-objects/)
	- My laser beam is based on [this](http://steredenn-game.tumblr.com/post/98397504410/steredenn-making-an-expandable-laser) with some upgrade (growing laser).
